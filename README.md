# Fine-Tuning for LLMs

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various fine-tuning techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Notebooks

Here is a list of the notebooks included in this repository:

*   **Demo1_PromptingFlanT5.ipynb**: Demonstrates basic prompting with the Flan-T5 model for summarization and translation.
*   **Demo2_Prompting_FlanT5_ICL_FewShot.ipynb**: Shows how to use in-context learning and few-shot prompting with Flan-T5 for summarization, translation, and Q&A.
*   **Demo1_TransferLearning.ipynb**: A notebook for translating English to Spanish using the Flan-T5 model and the Helsinki-NLP/opus-100 dataset.
*   **Demo2_Translation_FlanT5_with_Evaluation.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates how to translate from English to Spanish using the Flan-T5 model and evaluate the results with ROUGE and BLEU scores.
*   **Demo1_LoRA_FineTuning_FLAN_T5.ipynb**: A notebook that shows how to perform LoRA fine-tuning on the FLAN-T5-base model for translation.
*   **Demo2_LoRA_Experiments.ipynb**: This notebook contains experiments with different ranks and batch sizes for LoRA fine-tuning.
*   **2_Solution.ipynb**: A notebook that demonstrates how to use few-shot learning with Flan-T5 to translate articles from English to Spanish.
*   **3_Solution.ipynb**: This notebook shows how to fine-tune the FLAN-T5 model for English-to-German translation using the WMT16 dataset.
*   **4_Solution.ipynb**: A notebook that demonstrates how to perform LoRA fine-tuning on the FLAN-T5-base model for sentiment classification.
*   **5_Solution1_DistilBERT_SST2_Transfer_Learning.ipynb**: This notebook shows how to perform sentiment analysis using a pre-trained DistilBERT model fine-tuned on the SST2 dataset.
*   **5_Solution2_FlanT5_SQuAD_v2_Question_Answering.ipynb**: A notebook that demonstrates how to perform question answering using a pre-trained Flan-T5 model fine-tuned on the SQuAD v2 dataset.
*   **5_Solution3_LoRA_FineTuning_Summarisation.ipynb**: This notebook shows how to fine-tune the FLAN-T5-base model for summarization using the DailyMail dataset.
*   **Demo-Chatbot_Flask_App_with_Sentiment_Summarization_QA.ipynb**: A notebook that sets up a Flask application for a chatbot that integrates sentiment analysis, summarization, and Q&A models.

## How to Run

To run these notebooks, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. You will also need to install the necessary Python packages, which are listed at the top of each notebook.
